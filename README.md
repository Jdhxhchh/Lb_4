1) Create the PalindromeChecker Class:
Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or Visual Studio Code.
Create a new file named PalindromeChecker.java.
Write the Java code for the PalindromeChecker class, which includes a static method isPalindrome to check if a given word is a palindrome. The code involves using String methods for removing spaces and converting to lowercase, as well as utilizing the StringBuilder class for easy string reversal.

2) Create the Main Class for Testing:
In the same editor or IDE, create another new file named Main.java.
Write the Java code for the Main class, which includes the main method for user input and testing the isPalindrome function. This code uses the Scanner class to read user input and invokes the isPalindrome method to check if the entered word is a palindrome.

3)Compile the Code:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the Java files are saved.
Compile the code using the javac command. 

4) Run the Program:
After successful compilation, run the program using the java command. 
This will execute the Main class, prompting the user to enter a word for palindrome checking.

5)Input a Word:
Enter a word when prompted by the program and press Enter.

6) View the Result:
The program will then display whether the entered word is a palindrome or not.
